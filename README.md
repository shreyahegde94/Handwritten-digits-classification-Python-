# Handwritten-digits-classification-Python-
Implemented a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network to classify handwritten digits with an accuracy of 95%. Additionally used the trained network to analyse more complex face datasets and did a performance comparison of Neural networks against Tensorflow implementation.  Language Used: Python Libraries: Numpy, Scikit
